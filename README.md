# RoboDojo
VEX IQ Simulator

The motivation for this project is to get VEX users interested in Unity. The ultimate end goal is a downloadable Unity Asset that can be used to create shareable arena asset bundles. 

This project serves as a base to start designing your own VEX arenas to navigate with an autonomous VEX IQ bot.

It compiles code from an .iqblocks file produced by VEX's VEXcode IQ Blocks software (Download: https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode-blocks)
